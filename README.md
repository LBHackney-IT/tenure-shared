# Hackney.Shared.Tenure
At Hackney, we have created NuGet Packages to prevent the duplication of common code when implementing our APIs.
This NuGet package will store the shared code related to a tenure that can then be used in the relevant projects. 

#### CircleCI Pipeline - Versioning
At present the pipeline does not automatically update the package version number.

**This means that for the NuGet `Push` command to work when code is merged to the release branch 
you must change the version number in the .csproj file according to the type of change you are making.**

The new version number should use the following format:

    Any specific version number follows the form Major.Minor.Patch[-Suffix], where the components have the following meanings:

    *Major*: Breaking changes
    *Minor*: New features, but backward compatible
    *Patch*: Backwards compatible bug fixes only
    *Suffix (optional)*: a hyphen followed by a string denoting a pre-release version
